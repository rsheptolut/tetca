- Include in activity log a summary of what the user was doing - active apps/windows, calls

- Add logging for debugging

- Show a confirmation window to confirm whether you're still working or on break. Then after the break ask if the break was really a break instead of an idle time of thinking sitting at the chair.

- Remove the need to close the program
  - Allow to Snooze - logged?
  - Make closing more difficult (under an option)
  - Log app shutdown and startup times, notify of shutdowns too, including crashes

- Improve installation experience

- Test on PC without .NET 9

- Test on PCs without voice engine

- React and log exceptions better

- Add more logging for troubleshooting, allow to turn on/off

- Vary the reminders to prevent the user getting used to them
	- Make the reminder window bigger each time
	- Put the close button in a different place each time
	- Force to interact with the window after some time passes
	- Have the user solve a simple task when it happens
	- Use GenAI (a text generator) to vary the reminders
	- Use an AI art generator to supplement messages with images to grab attention
	- Use some sort of DB of images/quotes, etc
	- Suggestions of what to do on a break, show 3 options and allow to choose. Each option gets you a reward / penalty?

- Allow playing sounds like mp3s

- Make more configurable
	- Text prompts
	- Plug ins of what to do for all events / plugin trackers (easier to fork than plugin probably)
	- Modular configuration (for example: work session, break, day work, etc))
	- Script configuration (allow to define config as a Builder pattern)
	- Configuration UI

- "It's just late" reminders
	- Don't call back to work if it's late
	- Remind to stop working if it's late

- Return sound device settings to what they were before voice notification

- Mute sound when it's late and a break is detected, unmute when deliberate activity detected

- Allow to configure 8h normalization

- Chat based reminders: send me messages like a human, accept answers (like a chat bot) with reasoning, work done details, etc
