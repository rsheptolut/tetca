# TETCA

## Descripton

A helper that measures your work activity on your Windows PC and reminds you to stop working by talking to you. No AI is used, just simple customizable predefined phrases. No button pushing necessary, because the app automatically measures your mouse, keyboard and meeting activity, filtering out noise. Suits programmers and similar, especially remote workers with flexible hours. Provides you a report of how much time you've worked each day.

## Name

TETCA = Tool for Effortless Tracking of Computer Activity

Also, тётка roughly translates to 'lady', and that's what we're calling her at home, because its main interface is speech synthesis in a woman's voice.

## Features

- Tracks your computer activity (time spent working vs taking breaks)
- Displays your current unbroken work session and your total work time for today
- Provides you a report on your activity that you can use for timesheets
- Doesn't treat midnight as the beginning of the next day, because coders can work past midnight sometimes
- Filters out noise - tiny bouts of activity that are probably not work, tiny bouts of inactivity that are probably just you thinking through the problem
- Measures your keyboard, mouse activity and captures meeting time
- Does not require you to click anything for it to start / stop capturing
- Reminds you to take regular breaks, reminds you to go back to work after a break, reminds you to stop working for the day
- Unobtrusive and designed for gently taking you out of your work hyperfocus
- However, if you don't listen, it will escalate by messaging your human buddy
